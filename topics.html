<h3>Investing!</h3>
<p>Investing is a way to potentially increase the amount of money you have. The goal is to buy financial products, also called investments, and hopefully sell them at a higher price than what you initially paid. When you invest, you're purchasing products and keeping your money in a specified investment account.</p>


<h4>Stocks </h4>
<p>Stocks are high risk securities(investments), which might result in higher profits/returns. Stocks are parts of a company which can be bought by individuals in the public stock market or the private market(investing in a friend's or family's business) A stockâ€™s value can go up and down, depending on how well a company is doing. However, the value can go down when there are scandals or risks within a company's image, for example,  if corporate records are tampered with or when CEOs lie.</p>

<h4>Mutual funds </h4>
<p>A mutual fund is a collection of securities such as stocks, bonds, foreign exchange and other assets. This fund is managed by professional fund managers who attempt to create profit. The fund is safer than individual stocks as it comprised of various types of securities making it less volatile(risky).</p>

<h4>Budgeting!</h4>
<p>Being able to allocate money for different expenses might sound simple, but it is important to stick to the budgets you've created for yourself. A budget includes your income along with the expenses and how much they cost. There are fixed and variable expenses. Fixed expenses are those which don't change such as rent, car payments, groceries etc. Meanwhile variable costs are those which can change such as buying clothes, food etc.</p>

<h4>Sole Proprietorship</h4>
<p>As the name suggests in this ownership structure, there is only one owner. They are responsible for any debts, payments that the business incurrs but they are also the only people who receive the profits.   </p>

<h4>Partnership </h4>
<p> A partnership is similar, but instead of one owner there are two or more. There is no legal structure within a partnership but the partners usually have some type of agreement that defines the sharing of revenues, expenses and tasks.</p>

<h4>Corporation</h4>
<p>A corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable. Corporations offer the strongest protection to its owners from personal liability, but the cost to form a corporation is higher than other structures. </p>

<h3>Sectors</h3>
<h4>Primary</h4> 
<p>The primary sector of industry is concerned with the extraction of raw materials or natural resources from the land. Any business that grows goods or extracts materials from the land would be classed as a primary sector business.</p>

<h4> Secondary</h4>
<p>The secondary sector of industry is concerned with manufacturing . This would involve taking the raw materials from the primary sector and converting them into new products. Examples of businesses that operate in the secondary sector would be car manufacturers, food production or building companies.</p>

<h4> Tertiary</h4>
<p>The tertiary sector of industry is concerned with providing a service. Services are activities that are done by people or businesses for consumers.

Examples of businesses that operate in the tertiary sector would be hairdressers, banks, supermarkets or cinemas.</p>
